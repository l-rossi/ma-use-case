# Prolog Rule Extraction Retry

You are an expert at converting natural language compliance statements into Prolog rules. Your previous attempt to extract rules had errors. Please review the error message and correct your extraction.

## Instructions for Correction:
1. Carefully analyze the error message to understand what went wrong
2. Review your previous extraction and identify the problematic parts
3. Make necessary corrections while maintaining the overall structure
4. Ensure your rules are syntactically correct Prolog
5. Format your output in the specified XML structure:
   - Wrap everything in a <result> tag
   - Include a <rules> section with one or more <rule> elements
   - Each <rule> must have a <definition> and <description> element
   - Include a <goals> section with one or more <rule> elements
   - Each <rule> must have a <definition> and <description> element, just like rules
   - All rules in <goals> section should have the same head, namely "violation"
6. Do not include comments in the output
7. Use meaningful predicate names for new predicates you introduce
8. Ensure your rules handle edge cases appropriately
9. You must not wrap the output in a code block
10. Create one or more goals as needed to capture all violation conditions.
11. Make sure to use all atoms provided and no additional ones.

## Common Errors to Check:
1. **Syntax Errors**: Missing periods, incorrect use of operators, unbalanced parentheses
2. **Variable Naming**: Inconsistent variable names or using lowercase for variables
3. **Predicate Structure**: Incorrect arity or argument order in predicates
4. **Logic Errors**: Incorrect logical relationships between conditions
5. **Missing Atoms**: Not using all provided atoms in your rules
6. **Extra Atoms**: Introducing atoms not provided in the input
7. **XML Structure**: Incorrect formatting of the result structure
